This Modal Window project is a part of the JavaScript Bootcamp taught by Jonas Schemdtmann on Udemy. The project focuses on DOM manipulation and provides an interactive modal window experience for users.

You can access it here - https://fixmanish.github.io/modal-window/

## Project Overview 📝

The Modal Window project creates a modal window that can be triggered by three different buttons. When a button is clicked, the modal window is displayed, allowing users to view additional content or perform specific actions. The modal window can be closed in three ways: by clicking the ❌ button, clicking outside the modal window, or pressing the 'esc' key. The project demonstrates the use of event handling and DOM manipulation to create interactive user interfaces.

## Project Features 🌟
